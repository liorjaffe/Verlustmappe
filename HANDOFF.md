# Session handoff
At the end of a session, update this file: done / blocked / decisions needed /
next step. Read this file, SPEC.md, and the assigned tasks/Pxx_*.md before
starting work.

## Done

- Tagged the unmodified baseline `d060c9b` as `legacy-1.0` (frozen legacy state).
- Repo hygiene: `.gitignore` added, 66 binary artifacts untracked (`9d9ae80`),
  minimal `pyproject.toml` added (`b483fd4`).
- `AGENTS.md` rebuilt (`543548a`, `6830fd4`): SPEC primacy, tag-based legacy
  freeze with the `models/params.py` adapter exception, protected paths,
  branch rules, ci_guard limits, calibration paths split.
- `DECISIONS.md`: D1-D9 (+D3b) with status fields (`6c161a4`, `01af2df`);
  see `DECISIONS.md` for titles and status.
- Bundle commit (`9dc7476`): rebuilt `SPEC.md`, new `ROADMAP.md` (M0-M6), new
  `docs/94_known_defects_legacy.md` (C1-C12), `.github/CODEOWNERS` extended to
  all 13 protected paths, matching AGENTS.md.

## Blocked

- GitHub branch protection cannot be configured from repository files. A
  repository administrator must require pull requests, code-owner review, and
  passing status checks for `main`. Until then, CODEOWNERS is preparation only.

## Decisions needed

- Open in `DECISIONS.md`: D1, D3, D4, D5, D6, and the "Pending decisions"
  section (POA source, Kaeser metering, tank retrofit, fuelcell_analyzer.html).
- Battery registry conflict: `bat.capacity_Ah` is a BACKLOG placeholder (100 Ah)
  and `bat.nominal_V` is set to 52 V, but the GTEM-48V5000-E datasheet says
  105 Ah / 5 kWh and 48 V nominal (52 V is the Regatron bus setpoint). Needs a
  DECISIONS entry (D10) before any registry change.

## Next step

P02 is complete (implementation commits: `1f0a0e7`, `7047101`).
- P03: C9 registry-leak fix in tests, in an owner-approved tests commit.
- P04: first upgrade `tools/ci_guard.py` to compare parsed registry entries
  (value, uncertainty, status); then perform D1-authorized text cleanup,
  including the remaining `src/` SMA wording, and add the SOURCES stage-1 entry.

Later:
- D9 (a)-(d) in one commit together with the first new test file
  (`tests/test_20_static_map.py`) in M1, as D9 requires.
- M1 per `ROADMAP.md`.
- Backlog: migrate the 87 registry citations into complete `SOURCES.md` entries.
